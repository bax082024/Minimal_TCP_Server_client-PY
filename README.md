# FizzBuzz

- Classic fizzbuzz just made for fun, used colorama for color output in terminal.

## How it works 

Start counting from 1 to 100.

For each number:

If itâ€™s divisible by both 3 and 5 = "FizzBuzz".

Else if divisible by 3 = "Fizz".

Else if divisible by 5 = "Buzz".

Else = the number itself.

Move to the next number until you reach 100.
